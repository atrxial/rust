Installing packages like `tch-rs` on your laptop involves a few steps. I'll guide you through the process:

1. Install Rust:
   If you haven't already, you need to install Rust. Visit https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and follow the instructions for your operating system.

2. Install C++ build tools:
   - On Windows: Install Visual Studio 2019 with C++ build tools.
   - On macOS: Install Xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install`.
   - On Linux: Install GCC and other build essentials with your package manager.

3. Install LibTorch:
   `tch-rs` requires LibTorch, which is the C++ distribution of PyTorch.

   - Download LibTorch from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
   - Choose the appropriate version for your system (CPU or CUDA if you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU)
   - Extract the downloaded archive to a location on your computer

4. Set environment variables:
   You need to set the `LIBTORCH` environment variable to point to your LibTorch directory.

   - On Windows (PowerShell):
     ```
     $env:LIBTORCH = "C:\path\to\libtorch"
     $env:Path += ";$env:LIBTORCH\lib"
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     export LIBTORCH=/path/to/libtorch
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIBTORCH}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```

5. Create a new Rust project:
   ```
   cargo new my_tch_project
   cd my_tch_project
   ```

6. Add `tch-rs` to your project:
   Edit `Cargo.toml` and add under
